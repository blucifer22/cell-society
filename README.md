A lot of time. These times are not 100% accurate but shows that collectively we all spent a lot of
time working on the code.

### Primary Roles

### Resources Used

**JUnit** - To create automated unit tests and verify that changes did not break code.

### Running the Program

Main class: `cellsociety.Main`

Data files needed: To load a simulation the configurations can be found within `/data/`. All other
files needed to run are nested within the `/sr/main/resources/` directory.

Features implemented:

* **EIGHT** different Cellular Automata simulations
    * Conway's Game of Life
    * Fire Spreading
    * Percolation
    * Schelling's Model of Segregation
    * Wa-Tor World
    * Rock-Paper-Scissors
    * SugarScape
    * Foraging Ants
    

* Localization for:
    * English
    * Spanish
    * French
    * Polish
    

* Theming (in CSS!):
    * Light Mode (default)
    * Dark Mode
    * Fire Mode
